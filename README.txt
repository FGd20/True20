Fantasy Grounds II Ruleset for Green Ronnin's True20 Adventure Roleplaying

This repository contains a custom ruleset for Smitework's Fantasy Grounds II.
To use/test this repository during development you should clone it to your
FGII ruleset directory.  By default, FGII ruleset data is stored in:
C:/User/Username/AppData/Roaming/Fantasy Grounds/rulesets
Note, however, that a custom installation may require you to install the 
ruleset elsewhere.

Once cloned, your fully-licensed host may create a new campaign using the 
True20 ruleset as it exists in the repository.  FGII clients will recieve the
ruleset as the players connect.  Updates to the ruleset repository will be 
applied to any existing campaigns that have selected the True20 ruleset.

Please note that this ruleset is created for/by hobbiests for use in their
FGII sessions.  This ruleset is not supported or authorized by
Smiteworks or Green Ronin.  Portions of the conversion may be incomplete
or non-functional.  Use at your own risk.
