FGII Ruleset for Green Ronnin's True20 Adventures

This directory contains a ruleset for Smitwork's Fantasty Grounds II.  To use this 
ruleset, this ruleset must be placed in the Fantasty Grounds II data
directory.

By default, FGII data is stored in /User/Username/AppData/Roaming/Fantasy Grounds

The directory should be placed in the FGII data "rulesets" subdirectory.  When a 
fully licensed host creates a new campaign, the True20 should be available to 
select.

Changes to the ruleset will affect campaign that are created using previous
versions of the ruleset.
