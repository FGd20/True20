FGII Ruleset for Green Ronnin's True20 Adventures

This directory contains a ruleset for Smitwork's Fantasty Grounds II.  To use this 
ruleset, this ruleset must be placed in the Fantasty Grounds II data
directory.

By default, FGII data is stored in /User/Username/AppData/Roaming/Fantasy Grounds

The directory can be unzipped and placed in the rulesets subdirectory.  When a 
fully liscenced host creates a new campaign, this ruleset should not be available.
Changes to the ruleset will affect the campaign after creation.

The extenstion on the .zip archive can also be renamed (.pak) and placed in the rulesets
directory towards the same effect.
