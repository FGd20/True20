TODO

* General
- Update 3.5 stats with bonuses to True20 'bonuses only' model.  Characters
  work fine 'as is' by entering the appropriate 3.5 base stat for any 
  particular bonus, but this should eventually be corrected.
- Add/update all built in effects to True20.

* Base rolls
- Implement mental grapple properly

* Powers
- Power check is currently kludged together using ActionSkill.performRoll.  This has several side effects and should be redone more carefully. 
- implement fatigue check
- track currently maintained powers?  
- Add concentration check to power?

* Damage resolution
- auto crit damage modifier automatically
- auto resolve toughness checks and apply damage/effects: wounded, dazed, etc.

* Recovery
- Update rests?  
- Implement recovery check?

* Add corruption score?

* Implement autofire?
-- Damage / toHit mechanics would have to be added
-- True20 autofire weapons have a default clip size of 30 and use 10 ammo per burst, automate
-- auto of ammo checks?

* Remove 3.5isms from combat tracker and track attacks/damage as per True20

----- Non True20 wishlist ----
* Add GM selection option that allows players to share some host/GM functions.  For example:
* Give clients that ability to add/remove effects from combat tracker and/or create campaign effects?
- Add chat message that notes (for all) what has been done and by whom so nothing is done by mistake.
* Give clients the ability to lock/unlock token movement.

--- Known Bugs to address ---
