TODO

* General
- Minor update 'required'? Currently using 3.5 ability scores to set bonuses 
  equal to True20 model.  Characters work fine 'as is' by entering the 
  appropriate 3.5 base stat but this should eventually be corrected.
- Add/update all built in effects to True20.

* Combat Tracker
- Issue to fix: Implemented dropping damage onto GM CT non-lethal damage areas 
  (bruised, dazed) rolls toughness with non-lethal damage mods.  Likewise
  dropping damage onto GM/Host CT lethal damage areas does lethal damage (unless
  the damage was already TYPE: nonlethal).  BUT the client-side CT script always
  does a check using lethal modifiers.  Too tired to track this down atm, so adding
  it here for future effort.
- When impelementing damage in CT I used existing field names from 3.5 version.  The
  field names should be changed in ct/ct_hosts,ct_clients and in ct/scripts/ct_entry
  in order to track down all usage of the old field names and prevent side effects
- When dealing with the issue above, also update onWoundsChanged() and decide how
  we would like to color damage.  Should accumulated hurt/wounds eventually turn red?
  should that point be determined based on the character's toughness.  For example"
  red:  On a toughness roll of a 1, you could die
  yellow: On a roll of a 1, you could become disabled.
  green: On a roll of 1 1, you could take a wound.
  Would this be nice, or distracting?  It depends on the incoming damage, of course,
  so what would be the 'typical' damage used for coloring?

* Combat
- Implement mental grapple properly
- ?? Automatically use best of parry/dodge for melee attack defense

* Damage resolution
- ?? auto resolve toughness checks and apply damage/effects: wounded, dazed, etc.

* Powers
- ?? Power check is currently kludged together using ActionSkill.performRoll. This
  has several side effects and should be redone more carefully.  Check how the 
  fatigue check is now done (more developer experience was gained) 
- Add powers maintained as a penalty to power check?  (Technically it increases
  the DC, but we want to SEE the save DC for chart lookups and would probably 
  be better implemented as a check penalty.  This would not be cannon RAW).
- Add concentration check to power?

* Recovery
- Update rests?  
- Implement recovery check?

* Add corruption score?

* Firearms
- Add ballistic as an allowable damage type
- Implement autofire?
- This may not be necessary.  Multi-targetting and a user modifer may be the 
  way to go here.
- True20 autofire weapons have a default clip size of 30 and use 10 ammo per burst, automate
  ammo checks?

* Continue to remove 3.5isms from combat tracker and track attacks/damage as per True20

----- Non True20 wishlist ----
* Add GM selection option that allows players to share some host/GM functions.  For example:
* Give clients that ability to add/remove effects from combat tracker and/or create campaign effects?
- Add chat message that notes (for all) what has been done and by whom so nothing is done by mistake.
* Give clients the ability to lock/unlock token movement.

--- Known Bugs to address ---
True20weapon Dmg Details:  Weapon base damage shadow/hover outline is missized.
True20power Power check details:  Power check base ranks shadow/hover outline is missized.
